# Project Title: Equality Across the World  - Juan Zumarán

### Programming for Cultural Heritage - Pratt Institute
Project to visualize the different equality index values throughout the world

## Description
.
Gathered data from Equaldex.com, a public API with data for at least 197 countries on LGBT data. They include their own equality index, that ranks the countries from 1 to 100 (higher is better), and there is data for a “Legal Index” (from 0 to 90), regarding legal initiatives and the penalization of being LGBTQ+ in those countries (higher Legal index is better). Lastly, there is data on the “Public Opinion” index, where registered users can upvote or downvote a country based on data and submit comments that require approval. 

The goal of this project is to analyze the data from a world perspective, a continent perspective, and an in-depth analysis into the “best” countries to be LGBTQ+ in or travel to, and the “worst” ones. Does the Equality Index vary from country to country visually? How do different continents compare? What can we say about the lowest ranking countries? 

## Rationale

There is a rising movement of anti-woke / anti-LGBTQ+ that is unprecedented for the last decade, and new political groups are getting stronger everyday advocating against gay marriage, gay adoption, gender affirming care, gender re-assingment and other LGBTQ+ basic human rights. 

This project aims to show the differences in countries and also the variance in regions like continents. With the data of public opinion, there is an aim to show which countries are not safe for LGBTQ+ tourists and residents and which are the reasons why.
